# Car Exterior Body Parts Localization

A deep learning-based project that aims to localize 14 exterior car body parts in case of no or partial damage.


## Dataset Sources

1.   [DSMLR Body Parts Segmentation Dataset Github.](https://github.com/dsmlr/Car-Parts-Segmentation)
2.   [CompCars Dataset.](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/datasets/comp_cars/)
3.   [Stanford Cars Dataset.](https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html)
4.   [Used cars Auction Nation live auctions.](https://www.auctionnation.co.za/)

## Project Approach
1.   The data collected from sources 2-4 were manually annotated using [Microsoft VOTT](https://github.com/microsoft/VoTT).
2.   Annotations from source 1 were edited and the labels out of interest were removed.
3.   Data was split over train, validation, and test.
4.   Transfer learning was deployed as Yolov5 and Yolov8 state-of-the-art object detection CNNs were tuned and trained.

## Repo Content 
1.   How to use guide :  setup.md
2.   Source code as jupyter notebook : BodyParts.ipynb


## Results
The model was capable of detecting the body parts even the partially damaged.
